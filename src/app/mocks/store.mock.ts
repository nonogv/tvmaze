As such, <i>NFL Live</i> is not a highlight show, as Sunday and Monday game highlights are handled by the various other NFL studio shows, including <i>NFL Primetime</i> during the season. Unlike shows for other sports, <i>NFL Live</i> even runs throughout the entire off season.</p>",

The show was created by veteran newsmen Robert MacNeil &amp; Jim Lehrer, and has been on the air since 1975. In 2009, the show, previously known as The NewsHour With Jim Lehrer, became PBS NewsHour. One of the major differences between network news and the PBS NewsHour is that because the show is publicly funded, there are no commercials. This allows the NewsHour to dedicate more time to comprehensive reporting.</p>",

As her most fervent acolytes came to live with Amy, they cared for \"Mother God,\" whose health gradually declined. Amy's followers joined her in believing that her physical demise was the result of her taking on the pain of the world, and that her deterioration would ultimately lead to her evacuation by UFO and salvation for humanity. Told through the eyes of Amy's devotees, both former and still practicing, and constructed almost entirely from the cult's archival footage, the series captures the early boom of internet proselytizing and the perils of a conspiracy-driven faith.Â </p>",

Driven by powerful, real-life stories, Fatal Attraction weaves together intimate, first-person interviews, exclusive interrogation footage and rare archival material. Along the way, it gives you a glimpse into the dark heart of a dangerous romance. Listen as the key players, family of the survivors and those that investigated the horrific crimes reveal the secrets to each sordid tale. Fatal Attractionâ¦because love doesn't just hurt. It can kill!</p>",

          summary: "<p>Nie Qing Cheng is a half demon, except she doesn't know it herself. Or the fact that her mother's demon clan helped shape the Qing Dynasty and their control ended with Eight-Nation Alliance invading China. Her father had raised her as a human child after her mother died in the conflict. But when a scientist exposed her true form and a fellow half-demon vying for her love, she wonders if her human side can prevail and if her human lover will stand by her side to the end.</p>",
